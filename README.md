# Cyclistic-Analysis
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

The following markdown files were generated by Rstudio and serve as a guided walkthrough of my data cleaning, analysis, and visualization processes following my completion of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/44242a2f58ce42b463accf98a63ac239) course.

This project involved using a dataset of 6.5 million trip records collected by a ficitonal bike-share company over the course of one year in order to shape future marketing campaigns. In addition to this data, I chose to bring in publicly-available weather data for the period of study, which greatly improved my insights.
